A useful way to generate music from a locale as well as a time period.
Should generate all the music you'll ever need (if you like techno)



It works by taking all the Djs from a given club on resident advisor for the last year. 
From there it writes the djs top 10 tracks to a file.
After that it takes the tracks and finds them on youtube via the Google API.
From there it plays them in youtube opening them firefox.
it stores the url for fast look up later.
